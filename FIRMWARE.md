# FIRMWARE
My version of ZMK firmware  with Github Actions pipeline is located here:
https://github.com/Lefuneste83/zmk-config-klor
It has both encoders working, precise pulse per rotation adjustments and RGB enabled by default.

Config files for both QMK and ZMK can be found here:

For extra convienence if you intend to modify your firmware for a smaller layout, I have created a link to a [polydactyl layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/49ff09e68b46feb39760467424a4601a) on the layout editor website.
